Every page starts somewhere! This is very basic markup to start with. This sets the language of the page using the `lang` attribute on `html`, it sets the character set using `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, makes the page responsive with `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">`, adds proper meta for the site icon, and gives us a class of `no-js` to use in the event that JavaScript fails to load.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" class="no-js">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

    <title>Page title</title>

    <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico">
    <link rel="icon" href="/icon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
    <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest">

    <script type="module">
        document.documentElement.classList.remove('no-js');
        document.documentElement.classList.add('js');
    </script>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <script src="scripts.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Manifest file

A manifest file can define icons, in addition to the icons defined above, for those browsers that wish to take advantage of them.

```json
{
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/icon-192.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "192x192" },
    { "src": "/icon-512.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "512x512" }
  ]
}
```

## async vs defer

When adding a script, it's important to consider when the script needs to execute, and load it no earlier than necessary. Here's a great article explaining the options: [https://zellwk.com/blog/javascript-async-and-defer/](https://zellwk.com/blog/javascript-async-and-defer/)

## Images

Images should have a width and height attribute so that the browser knows how much space to reserve for them, and they should include an alt attribute, even if empty, for screen readers.

## SVG

It's best to inline SVGs if possible, as this cuts out an HTTP request, and makes them easier to style depending on their context.

If using an inline SVG as a decorative accompaniment to a text label (even if it's screen reader text), it's good to add these two attributes to hide it from screen readers and ensure that IE users cannot tab to it.

```html
aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"
```

It's also good to add a height and width to the SVG element itself, in the event that CSS fails to load. This could be difficult or undesirable if the icon is used in several locations across a project at different sizes.

```html
width="1em" height="1em"
```
